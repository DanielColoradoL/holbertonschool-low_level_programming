Arithmetic Operators
In C, you can perform basic arithmetic operations using operators such as + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), and % (modulo). These operators allow you to manipulate numeric values.

Example:

c
Copy code
int a = 5, b = 3;
int sum = a + b;  // sum is now 8
<a name="logical-operators"></a>

Logical Operators
Logical operators, also known as boolean operators, include && (logical AND), || (logical OR), and ! (logical NOT). They are used to combine and evaluate conditions.

Example:

c
Copy code
int x = 5, y = 3;
if (x > 4 && y < 2) {
    // This condition will not be met
}
<a name="relational-operators"></a>

Relational Operators
C includes relational operators like < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to), == (equal to), and != (not equal to) to compare values and create conditional expressions.

Example:

c
Copy code
int age = 20;
if (age >= 18) {
    // You are considered an adult
}
<a name="true-and-false-values"></a>

TRUE and FALSE Values
In C, the value 0 is considered FALSE, and any non-zero value is considered TRUE. This concept is crucial when working with conditional statements and boolean expressions.

Example:

c
Copy code
int isTrue = 10; // This is considered TRUE
int isFalse = 0; // This is considered FALSE
<a name="boolean-operators"></a>

Boolean Operators
Boolean operators are used to create conditional expressions in C. You can combine logical and relational operators to build complex conditions.

Example:

c
Copy code
int a = 5, b = 10;
if (a > 3 && b < 15) {
    // This condition is met
}
<a name="if-and-if-else-statements"></a>

If and If-Else Statements
Conditional statements are fundamental in C. Use if and if-else statements to execute code based on specific conditions.

Example:

c
Copy code
int num = 8;
if (num % 2 == 0) {
    // This code block is executed for even numbers
} else {
    // This code block is executed for odd numbers
}
<a name="comments"></a>

Comments
Comments in C are used for documentation and code readability. They are not executed and can be single-line (//) or multi-line (/* ... */).

Example:

c
Copy code
// This is a single-line comment

/*
This is a
multi-line
comment
*/

Variable Declarations
In C, you declare variables using their data types. Common data types include char, int, and unsigned int. You can declare variables like this:

c
Copy code
int age;
char initial;
unsigned int count;
<a name="assigning-values-to-variables"></a>

Assigning Values to Variables
You can assign values to variables using the = operator.

Example:

c
Copy code
int x = 42;
char grade = 'A';
unsigned int count = 100;
<a name="printing-variables-with-printf"></a>

Printing Variables with printf
To display the values of variables, use the printf function in C.

Example:

c
Copy code
int num = 7;
printf("The value of num is %d\n", num);
<a name="using-the-while-loop"></a>

Using the While Loop
The while loop allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.

Example:

c
Copy code
int count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
    printf("Count: %d\n", count);
    count++;
}
<a name="working-with-variables-in-the-while-loop"></a>

Working with Variables in the While Loop
You can manipulate variables within a while loop, making it a powerful tool for iterative tasks.

Example:

c
Copy code
int total = 0;
int i = 1;
while (i <= 10) {
    total += i;
    i++;
}
<a name="printing-variables-using-printf-in-a-loop"></a>

Printing Variables Using printf in a Loop
You can combine loops and printf to repeatedly display variable values.

Example:

c
Copy code
int i;
for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    printf("Iteration %d\n", i);
}
<a name="understanding-the-ascii-character-set"></a>

Understanding the ASCII Character Set
ASCII is a character encoding standard in which characters are represented by numeric codes. ASCII values are used extensively in C programming, especially for character manipulation and input/output operations.

GCC Flags -m32 and -m64
The GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) flags -m32 and -m64 are used to specify the target architecture for 32-bit and 64-bit systems, respectively. These flags control the compilation process and help generate code that is compatible with the specified architecture.

Example:

bash
Copy code
gcc -m32 my_program.c -o my_program32   # Compile for 32-bit
gcc -m64 my_program.c -o my_program64   # Compile for 64-bit
