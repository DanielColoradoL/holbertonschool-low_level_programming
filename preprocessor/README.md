Welcome to the C Macros README! This document provides essential information about macros in the C programming language and how to use them effectively. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, understanding macros is crucial for efficient and maintainable C code.

What are Macros and How to Use Them
In C, macros are a powerful tool for code generation and preprocessor manipulation. Macros are defined using the #define directive and are primarily used for text substitution before the actual compilation process begins. They allow you to create reusable pieces of code and customize your programs based on compile-time parameters.

To define a simple macro, use the following syntax:

c
Copy code
#define MY_MACRO(parameter)   // Macro definition
// ... your code using MY_MACRO
To use the macro:

c
Copy code
MY_MACRO(value);  // Macro invocation
Remember to use parentheses around parameters in macro definitions to avoid unexpected behavior.

Common Predefined Macros
C provides several predefined macros that offer information about the compilation environment and can be useful in conditional compilation. Some of the most common predefined macros include:

__FILE__: Represents the current file name.
__LINE__: Represents the current line number in the source code.
__func__ (or __FUNCTION__): Represents the current function name.
These macros can be leveraged to make your code more portable and adaptable to different compilation environments.

How to Include Guard Your Header Files
Header files often contain declarations and definitions that need to be included in multiple source files. To prevent multiple inclusion and avoid redefinition errors, include guards are used.

Here's an example of how to use include guards in a header file:

c
Copy code
// my_header.h
#ifndef MY_HEADER_H
#define MY_HEADER_H

// ... your code here

#endif // MY_HEADER_H
This ensures that the content of the header file is only included once in each translation unit, preventing duplicate symbol definitions.
