General
This README provides an overview of some fundamental programming concepts and commonly used GCC flags that can be beneficial for C and C++ programmers.

Nested Loops
Nested loops refer to a situation in which one loop is placed inside another loop. This allows for the execution of one loop (the inner loop) within the context of another loop (the outer loop). Nested loops are useful for iterating through multi-dimensional data structures, such as arrays or matrices. Here's an example of how to use nested loops in C:

c
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
        // Nested loop code here
    }
}
Functions
A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are a fundamental building block in programming, allowing you to modularize and reuse code. To use a function, you typically define it with a function signature and body and then call it from within your program.

c
Copy code
// Function declaration
int add(int a, int b);

// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Function call
int result = add(3, 5);
Declaration vs. Definition of a Function
A declaration of a function provides information about the function's name, return type, and parameters, allowing other parts of your code to call the function. A definition of a function provides the actual implementation of the function. You can declare a function without defining it, but you must define it if you intend to use it.

c
Copy code
// Function declaration (no implementation)
int multiply(int x, int y);

// Function definition
int multiply(int x, int y) {
    return x * y;
}
Prototype
A prototype is a declaration of a function without its implementation. It provides just enough information about the function's name, return type, and parameters for other parts of your code to use it. Prototypes are often placed in header files for use in multiple source files.

c
Copy code
// Function prototype in a header file (e.g., my_functions.h)
int multiply(int x, int y);

// Source file using the function
#include "my_functions.h"

int result = multiply(4, 7);
Scope of Variables
Variable scope defines where in your code a variable is accessible. In C and C++, variables can have local scope (limited to a specific block of code) or global scope (accessible throughout the entire program). Understanding variable scope is crucial for managing variable lifetimes and avoiding naming conflicts.

GCC Flags
GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is a widely used compiler for C and C++ programming. Here are some commonly used GCC flags:

-Wall: Enable most warning messages.
-Werror: Treat all warnings as errors, causing the compilation to fail on warnings.
-pedantic: Issue all the mandatory diagnostic messages required by the C and C++ standards.
-Wextra: Enable some extra warning messages.
-std=gnu89: Specify the language standard to be used. In this case, it's C89 (ANSI C).
These flags help you catch potential issues in your code and ensure it adheres to the specified language standard.

Header Files and #include
Header files are used to declare and prototype functions, variables, and other program elements. You include header files in your source code using the #include preprocessor directive. Header files are essential for code organization, modularity, and managing complex projects.

c
Copy code
// Including a header file in your source code
#include "my_header.h"

// Now you can use functions and variables declared in my_header.h
Make sure to provide the correct path to your header files when using the #include directive.
