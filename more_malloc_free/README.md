Exit Function Usage
Overview
The exit function in programming is a standard library function that is used to terminate a program. It can be employed to gracefully exit a program or to handle unexpected errors. This README provides guidance on how to use the exit function effectively.

How to Use the Exit Function
Include the necessary header file:

Make sure to include the appropriate header file at the beginning of your program.

c
Copy code
#include <stdlib.h>
Call the exit function:

To use the exit function, simply call it with an integer argument that represents the exit status. The exit status is typically used to indicate the success or failure of the program.

c
Copy code
exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); // or exit(0) for success
c
Copy code
exit(EXIT_FAILURE); // or exit(1) for failure
You can customize the exit status based on your specific requirements.

Clean Up Before Exiting:

It's good practice to perform any necessary cleanup operations before calling the exit function. This might include freeing allocated memory, closing files, or releasing any acquired resources.

Example
c
Copy code
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Your program logic here

    if (/* some condition indicating an error */) {
        fprintf(stderr, "An error occurred\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Clean up operations if needed

    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
Calloc and Realloc Functions
Overview
The calloc and realloc functions are standard library functions in C that deal with dynamic memory allocation. calloc is used to allocate memory for an array of elements, initializing them to zero, while realloc is used to change the size of a previously allocated block of memory.

How to Use Calloc and Realloc
Include the necessary header file:

Ensure you include the appropriate header file for dynamic memory allocation.

c
Copy code
#include <stdlib.h>
Use calloc to allocate memory:

The calloc function allocates a block of memory for an array of elements, each of a specified size. The memory is initialized to zero.

c
Copy code
void *ptr = calloc(num_elements, element_size);
Make sure to check if the allocation was successful before using the pointer.

Use realloc to resize memory:

The realloc function changes the size of a previously allocated block of memory.

c
Copy code
void *new_ptr = realloc(ptr, new_size);
Ensure to check if the reallocation was successful, as it may return a new pointer.

Example
c
Copy code
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    // Using calloc
    int *arr = (int *)calloc(5, sizeof(int));
    if (arr == NULL) {
        // Handle allocation failure
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Using realloc
    int *new_arr = (int *)realloc(arr, 10 * sizeof(int));
    if (new_arr == NULL) {
        // Handle reallocation failure
        free(arr); // Free the original memory
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Continue using the new_arr

    // Free allocated memory when done
    free(new_arr);

    return 0;
}
Feel free to customize the examples and integrate them into your code as needed. If you have further questions or encounter issues, refer to the documentation or community resources for additional assistance.
