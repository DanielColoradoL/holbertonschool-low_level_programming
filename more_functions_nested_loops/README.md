Nested Loops
Nested loops in C allow you to create loops within loops. This concept is used when you need to perform a repetitive task that has multiple levels or dimensions. Learn how to use nested loops to iterate through multi-dimensional arrays, perform matrix operations, or implement complex algorithms.

Functions
Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks. They are essential for organizing and simplifying your code. In this section, you will learn how to declare, define, and call functions in C, allowing you to encapsulate functionality for modularity and reusability.

Declaration vs. Definition
Understanding the difference between declaring and defining a function is crucial. A declaration informs the compiler about a function's name and signature, while a definition provides the actual implementation of the function. This section clarifies the distinction and demonstrates how to use both in your C programs.

Prototypes
Prototypes serve as function declarations that appear at the beginning of a program. They inform the compiler about the functions you plan to use in your code. Discover why prototypes are necessary and how to create and use them effectively.

Scope of Variables
In C programming, variables have different scopes, determining where they can be accessed and modified. Learn about the various scopes, such as global and local, and how they impact the lifetime and visibility of variables within your code.

GCC Flags
GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is a widely used compiler for C programs. Familiarize yourself with commonly used GCC flags, including:

-Wall: Enables many warning messages to help identify potential issues in your code.
-Werror: Treats warnings as errors, forcing you to fix them before compiling.
-pedantic: Enforces strict adherence to C standards.
-Wextra: Provides additional warning messages for potential problems.
-std=gnu89: Sets the C language standard to GNU C89.
Understanding and using these flags effectively can improve the quality of your code and its compliance with standards.

Header Files
Header files in C are used to declare functions, variables, and constants that are defined in other source files. Learn how to create and use header files with the #include preprocessor directive to facilitate code modularization and reuse.

With this guide, you'll be well-equipped to dive into C programming, master these essential concepts, and develop robust and efficient C applications. Happy coding!
