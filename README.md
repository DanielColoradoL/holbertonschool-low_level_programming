C Programming and Shell Scripting Project
Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without needing assistance from external sources:

General
The awesomeness of C programming.
The inventors of C programming.
The significance of Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds in the field.
The process that occurs when you use gcc main.c.
The meaning of an entry point in a C program.
The role of the main function.
How to print text using printf, puts, and putchar.
Using the unary operator sizeof to determine the size of a specific data type.
Compiling C code with gcc.
The default program name when compiling with gcc.
Adhering to the official C coding style and how to validate your code using betty-style.
Finding the correct header to include when using standard library functions in your source code.
How the main function affects the return value of a C program.
Requirements
C
Editors allowed: vi, vim, emacs.
Compilation will be done on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
Ensure that all C files end with a newline character.
A README.md file at the root of the repository, describing the repository.
A README.md file at the root of the project folder, describing the project.
Compilation should not produce any errors or warnings.
Prohibited use of the system function.
Code must adhere to the Betty style, which will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
Shell Scripts
Editors allowed: vi, vim, emacs.
All scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
All scripts must be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2).
Ensure all script files end with a newline character.
The first line of all script files should be #!/bin/bash.
These learning objectives and requirements are essential for mastering C programming and shell scripting while adhering to coding standards.
