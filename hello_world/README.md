This repository provides a collection of C programming scripts and code examples to help you perform various tasks, from pre-processing and compiling C code to printing messages and determining data type sizes.

Preprocessor Script
The preprocessor_script.sh allows you to run a C file through the preprocessor and save the preprocessed result into another file.

Compiler Script
The compiler_script.sh compiles a C file without linking, generating an object file that can later be linked to create an executable.

Assembler Script
The assembler_script.sh generates the assembly code of a C source code and saves it in an output file.

Create Executable Script
The create_executable.sh script compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.

Hello, puts
A C program (hello_puts.c) that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle," followed by a new line, using the puts function.

Hello, printf
A C program (hello_printf.c) that prints the message "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,", followed by a new line, using the printf function.

Size and Data Types
A C program (size_and_data_types.c) that prints the size of various data types on the computer it is compiled and run on. This script helps you understand the size of fundamental data types.

Please check the individual scripts and code examples for usage instructions and ensure you have a C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system.

Feel free to modify and distribute these scripts and examples according to the respective licenses and requirements of any third-party tools or libraries used.
