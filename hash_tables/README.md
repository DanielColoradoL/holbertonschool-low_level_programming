What is a Hash Function?
A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that transforms input data into a fixed-size string of characters, typically a hash value. It is commonly used in computer science for various applications, such as data integrity verification and indexing.

What Makes a Good Hash Function?
A good hash function should be deterministic, efficient, and produce unique hash values for distinct inputs. Collision resistance, where different inputs ideally produce different hash values, is a crucial characteristic.

What is a Hash Table?
A hash table is a data structure that uses hash functions to map keys to indexes in an array. This enables efficient data retrieval, as the hash value serves as an index for storing and accessing associated data.

How to Use Hash Tables?
To use a hash table, you associate keys with values and utilize a hash function to determine the index for storage. This facilitates rapid data retrieval based on the key.

What is a Collision?
A collision occurs when two different inputs produce the same hash value. Dealing with collisions is a key challenge in hash table implementation.

Dealing with Collisions in Hash Tables
Common collision resolution techniques include chaining (linked lists at each index) and open addressing (finding alternative slots).

Advantages and Drawbacks of Hash Tables
Advantages:

Efficient data retrieval.
Ideal for scenarios with large datasets.
Constant time complexity for average case lookup.
Drawbacks:

Possibility of collisions.
May require careful tuning of hash functions.
